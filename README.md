# Collaborative-Filtering

# 🎯Objective: 
 🎬 Leveraging Collaborative Filtering for Personalized Movie Recommendations 🎥

I delved into the world of recommendation systems and developed a personalized movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques!


# ⁉️What is a Recommendation System?

A Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict a user’s “rating” or “preference” towards a domain-specific item or item. In this case, this domain-specific item is a movie.

# Main Types of Recommendation Systems:

# Content-based Filtering: 
Content-based filtering is a recommendation strategy that suggests items similar to those a user has previously liked. It calculates similarity (often using cosine similarity) between the user’s preferences and item attributes, such as lead actors, directors, and genres.

# Collaborative Filtering: 
Collaborative filtering is a recommendation strategy that considers the user’s behavior and compares it with other users in the database. It uses the history of all users to influence the recommendation algorithm.

# Item-based Collaborative Filtering:
Item-based Collaborative Filtering focuses on finding similar movies instead of similar users to recommend to user ‘A’ based on their past preferences. 

In this implementation, when the user searches for a movie it will recommend the top similar movies using the movie recommendation system. I have used a item based collaborative filtering algorithm for this purpose. 

# 🔍Results and Impact:

The personalized movie recommendation system is effective in providing users with relevant movie suggestions based on their preferences. 

# 💡Key Learnings:

This project provided me with invaluable insights into recommendation systems and collaborative filtering techniques.
